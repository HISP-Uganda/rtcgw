The RTC Gateway (rtcgw)  is a golang application that helps with the integration of:
- **eCHIS** with **DHIS2 (eCBSS)** by saving clients/ presumptive TB patients in the "Presumptive TB Program"
- LabXpert with eCBSS by saving results from the Genexpert machine for the presumptive patients in the "Presumptive TB Program"
